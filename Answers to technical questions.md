# Answers to technical questions

## 1. How much time did you spend on this task?
I spent two days analyzing and implementing the solution.

## 2. If you had more time, what improvements or additions would you make?
I would implement support for fetching data from multiple weather services, so we could easily switch providers (e.g., from OpenWeather to another) if needed.

## 3. What is the most useful feature recently added to your favorite programming language?
Honestly, it's hard to say which is the most useful, but one interesting feature for me is **collection expressions** in C#.  
With this feature, we can easily merge or construct collections that implement `ICollection`.

**New Syntax (C# 12)**:
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;

List<int> evens = [2, 4, 6];
List<int> odds = [1, 3, 5];
List<int> all = [..evens, ..odds, 7, 9];
```

**Old Syntax**:
```csharp
var evens = new List<int> { 2, 4, 6 };
var odds = new List<int> { 1, 3, 5 };
var all = new List<int>();
all.AddRange(evens);
all.AddRange(odds);
all.Add(7);
all.Add(9);
```

## 4. How do you identify and diagnose a performance issue in a production environment?
Usually, it starts with unexpected results or errors in tests. If it's not caught there, it should be discovered and fixed during product testing.  
Yes, Iâ€™ve encountered cases where specific conditions caused issues in production that were not apparent during development.

## 5. What is the last technical book or conference you attended?
The last technical article I read was about the advancement of IoT in industries. It was presented at the 19th National Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology.  
It explained how real-time data exchange between smart devices in factories can increase efficiency and reduce production costs.

## 6. What do you think of this technical test?
It was a good test, although it seems to require a high evaluation effort from your team.

## 7. Describe yourself in JSON format
